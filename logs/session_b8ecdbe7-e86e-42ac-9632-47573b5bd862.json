        "description": "Secure a stay at a 4-star or higher hotel on the shores of Lake Como, in towns like Bellagio, Varenna, or Menaggio. Activities would include leisurely walks along the lakeside promenades, exploring charming villages, and taking boat trips. There are also gentler trails in the surrounding hills for those who wish to venture further. Dining options would include refined Italian cuisine, featuring pasta dishes."
