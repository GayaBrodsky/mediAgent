It offers Gaya a \"well-appointed lodge with good connectivity and amenities,\" directly addressing her deal-breaker of remote areas without good Wi-Fi and her priority for comfort. Simultaneously, it explicitly facilitates Adi with a \"guided, intense physical challenge (e.g., a 2-day trek with basic camping) into the adjacent wilderness,\" perfectly aligning with his need for nature and physical exertion. This option avoids catastrophic violations for Gaya while maximizing Adi's primary goal, and none of the options violate Rony's deal-breaker of a long flight."
