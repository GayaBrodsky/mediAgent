        "description": "Focus on a region in Italy known for its rich culinary heritage, such as Emilia-Romagna (Bologna for pasta) or Tuscany (Florence for food, art, and day trips). This allows for daily walks through historic towns, gentle cycling or hiking in the countryside, and ensures access to 4-star hotels with breakfast and shopping opportunities in larger cities."

        "description": "Consider a destination in the European Alps (e.g., Dolomites in Italy, Austrian Alps, Swiss Alps). This provides abundant opportunities for daily walks and hikes in stunning natural settings. Many hotels in these regions are 4-star, offer excellent dining (which can include healthy options and sometimes pasta, especially in the Italian Dolomites), and often feature spas. Nearby towns offer some shopping opportunities."

For example, parts of the Amalfi Coast or Cinque Terre in Italy, or consider other Mediterranean options like parts of Croatia, Greece, or southern France. These areas offer scenic walks, fresh cuisine (including pasta options), and 4-star hotels with access to charming towns for shopping. Activities could involve coastal walks, swimming, and exploring local markets."
